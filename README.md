# city-explorer-api

**Author**: Rey Mercado
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?)
This application is my own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application.  This means users will get to seenot only the map, but also interesting information about the area, provided by a variety of third-party APIs that my server will manage.

 -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. set up your server repository
2. Weather (placeholder): As a user of City Explorer, I want to see weather info for the city I searched, so that I know how to pack for an upcoming trip.
3. Errors (revisited): As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
Node, express, dotenv.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

## Credit and Collaborations

For group exercise of drawing out the web request-response cycle for the current lab tasks, Shane Roach, Hambalieu Jallow, and I were assigned to work together.
