# city-explorer-api-lab10-placeholder

**Author**: Rey Mercado
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?)
This application is my own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application.  This means users will get to seenot only the map, but also interesting information about the area, provided by a variety of third-party APIs that my server will manage.

2. Weather (placeholder): As a user of City Explorer, I want to see weather info for the city I searched, so that I know how to pack for an upcoming trip.
3. Errors (revisited): As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.
